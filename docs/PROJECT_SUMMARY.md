- **Data Validation**: Input validation for all fields including ICD10 codes, email, phone
- **Pagination Support**: Efficient handling of large patient datasets

### 2. Advanced Risk Assessment Engine
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: 
  - Age-based risk (17-20, 31-35 high risk; 21-30 medium risk)
  - Trimester-based risk (3rd trimester high, 1st medium, 2nd low)
  - Weather-based risk (heat waves, temperature thresholds)
  - Medical condition risk (ICD10 code analysis)
- **Real-time Weather Integration**: OpenWeatherMap API for current conditions
- **Heat Wave Detection**: Advanced algorithms for heat risk assessment
- **Risk Scoring**: 0-8 point scale with percentage calculation

### 3. Intelligent Notification System
- **AI-Powered Messages**: OpenAI GPT integration for personalized Russian messages
- **Context-Aware Content**: Patient-specific advice based on risk factors
- **Multiple Notification Types**: Heat warnings, general health, appointment reminders
- **Read Status Tracking**: Mark as read functionality with timestamps

### 4. Comprehensive REST API
- **Patient Endpoints**: Full CRUD with pagination
- **Risk Assessment**: Real-time assessment and history tracking
- **Notification Management**: Get, mark as read, bulk operations
- **System Health**: Health checks and weather data endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses and logging

### 5. Database Architecture
- **MySQL Integration**: Robust relational database design
- **Migration Support**: Flask-Migrate for schema management
- **Optimized Indexing**: Performance-optimized database queries
- **Data Relationships**: Proper foreign key constraints and cascading
